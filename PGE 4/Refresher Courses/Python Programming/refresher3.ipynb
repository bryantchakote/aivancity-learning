    "**Here are some key points on how to use the notebook and submit your work.**\n",
    "We will grade based on assuming you have read and understood them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. **Using the Notebook to Show Your Work**: You must learn to write code in the notebook... It is a core tool for data science and will make it easier to develop and document your work if you become good at using it. Writing your code in another tool and pasting it into the notebook will probably not work well (forgetting to include code elsewhere, messing up the spacing, or code that don't run as copied). You must be sure your code cells execute because we will test them.  So learn how to run code in the notebook cells to double check your work.\n",
    "2. **Read Directions Carefully**:  The instructions for your code are very important. If you don't follow the requirements, your application won't do as requested. Making it work correctly is part of learning to program.  If we worded something unclearly, ask the teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second set of issues are coding style:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indentation**: In Python, indentation matters and must be consistent. If you write your code in the Notebook, the **tab** key will indent properly.  If you use another editor and paste into the notebook, it might not be correctly indented (when you do write code in another editor, make sure you set your tabs to indent as 4 spaces, not as a tab character.)  You must make sure that your pasted code runs in the notebook or it will not get a good grade. Anyway, we recommend beginners to work in a Jupyter notebook for this course, whether it's this one or a draft file.\n",
    "2. **Spacing**: Follow closely the spacing shown in the lessons. There should not be a space  between a function name and the parentheses with the arguments. As a programmer, style is very important. If you work with programmers in the future, they sometimes have \"lint\" checkers to test your code for style and reject if it doesn't follow the approprate spacing and blank-line-rules. Think of it as a matter of politness for other people reading your code \\ (•◡•) /\n",
    "3. **Names of Variables**: In Python, there's a culture of making everything readable. Don't use ``x`` and ``y`` as your variable names... use words like ``pounds`` and ``kilograms``. It will be easier for colleagues (and yourself) to understand the code later.\n",
    "4. **Error Messages**: Please use informative error messages that tell the user what they did wrong and what kind of input you expect. Imagine you are designing the user experience! Think about how to help your user. And remember **you** are the user when you debug!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take points off for issues of non-standard spacing, indentation, bad error messages, and bad variable names in the future.  This will continue for the entire course.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to code all the answers.  Here are a few more code style tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you do a calculation or a transformation, like ``float(pounds)`` -- do it once and save it as a variable, don't do it multiple times.  You should try not to have code that repeats itself too much.  If you repeat things, you can make mistakes like typos and it will be harder to find them. Also, it's wasting computer power.\n",
    "2. Tests like \"4 < test < 40\" need to be saved in a variable or used in a ``if`` statement.  It won't do anything relevant otherwise.\n",
    "3. ``try``/``except`` should be used to catch errors. (In fancier, more formal Python, there is more careful error catching where the type of error is detected and handled. We're just doing the basic try/except right now.) Anytime you have a conversion or something that could result in an error, you should wrap it in try/except. Do not allow a user to run code that results in an un-handled error.\n",

The key will be the range name. Each time you see a new mountain in the range, add the height to the list for that key. For example, after reading all the data, ``mountains['Himalayas'] == [8848, 8586, 8516, 8485, 8201, 8167, 8163, 8126, 8091, 8027]``.  (The \"Himalayas\" are the range.)\n",
